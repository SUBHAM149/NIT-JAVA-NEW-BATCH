    todo : for in label & id in input tag with same values 

    ! placeholder vs label 
   todo :  label is a tag & placeholder is an attribute 

    todo :  when we click on label input field can be focused but we can't do this with placeholder 

    todo: placeholder is visible until input field is empty but not the same in the case of label
    
    todo : placeholder makes the ui simple and short not vice-versa
