ORACLE :-
----------------

 1   SQL
 2   PL/SQL

Database :-
----------------

=> a db is a organized collection of interrelated data.For ex a  bank db stores data 
     related to customers,accounts,transactions etc and a univ db stores data related
     to students,course and faculty

   
   Bank DB			UNIV DB

   customers			courses
   accounts			students
   transactions			faculty
   loans
   employees
 
 Types of Databases :-
 ------------------------------

 1 OLTP DB (online transaction processing)
 2 OLAP DB (online analytical processing)

 => day-to-day operations on db includes 

   C   create
   R   read
   U   update
   D  delete

DBMS :- 
-----------

 => Database Management System
 => DBMS is a software used to work with database.
 => using DBMS software we can create,read,update,delete data in db
 => DBMS is an interface between user and database.
 
    USER------------------DBMS--------------------DB

Types of DBMS  (Evolution of DBMS) :-
-------------------------------------------------------

 	1960		FMS    (file mgmt system)

	1970		HDBMS (hierarchical dbms)
			NDBMS (network dbms)

	1980		RDBMS  (relational dbms)

	1990		ORDBMS (object relational dbms)


 RDBMS :-
 --------------

  => Relational DBMS
  => RDBMS concepts introducedby Edgar Frank CODD
  => E.F.CODD introduced 12 rules called codd rules
  => a db software that supports all 12 rules is called perfect rdbms software

 Information Rule :- 
 --------------------------

 => according to information rule data must be organized in tables i.e. rows and columns

  CUSTOMER
  cid	cname	city         =>  columns / fields / attributes 
  10	sachin	mum
  11	vijay	hyd
  12	rahul	blr         => row / record / tuple

  DB = collection of tables
  Table = collection of rows and columns
  Row = collection of field values
  Column = collection of values belongs to one field

 => every table must contain primary key to uniquely identify 
 
 ex :-  accno,empid,aadharno,panno,voterid

  => one table related to another table using foreign key

 ex :- 

   projects
   projid	name	duration	cost	client
   100  	AAA	4	200	DBS Bank
   101	BBB	3	100	L&T

  emp
  empid	ename	job	sal	projid  (fk)
  1	A	SE	40K	100
  2	B	SSE	80K	101
  3	C	SE	30K	100

 RDBMS softwares :-
 -----------------------------

SQL Databases :-
------------------------

ORACLE		 oracle corp	
MYSQL		 oracle corp
SQL SERVER	 microsoft
POSTGRESQL	 postgresql 
DB2		 ibm

NO-SQL Databases :-
------------------------------

 ORDBMS :-  
 ------------------

  => Object Relational DBMS
  =>  It is the combination of RDBMS & OOPS

                ORDBMS  =  RDBMS + OOPS (reusability)

  => rdbms doesn't support reusability but ordbms supports reusability
 
 RDBMS :- 
 -------------

  cust
  cid	name	hno	street	city	state	pin

  emp
  empid	ename	hno	street	city	state	pin

  ORDBMS :- 
  -----------------

  ADDR
  hno	street	city	state	pin

 CUST
 cid	cname	addr

 EMP
 empid	ename	addr

 ORDBMS softwares :- 
 ------------------------------

  ORACLE
  POSTGRESQL
  
DB Development Life Cycle :- 
----------------------------------------

Analysis
Design
Develop
Test
Deploy
Maintain
 
DB Design :-
-----------------

  => Designing DB means designing tables
  => DB is designed by DB Designers / Architects
  => DB is designed by using

          1   ER Model  (Entity Relationship)
          2   Normalization

Development :- 
---------------------

  => DB is developed by DB Developers & DBAs (DB Administrator)
  => DB is developed by using any rdbms tools like ORACLE.

                  Developer			DBA
	
	  creating tables			installation of oracle
	  creating views			creating database
	  creating synonyms			creating userids
	  creating sequences		db backup & restore
	  creating indexes			db export & import
	  creating procedures		performance tuning
	  creating functions
	  creating triggers
	  writing queries

  Test :- 
  -----------

   => DB is tested by QA (Quality Assurance) team by  

               1   manually
               2   automatically (using selenium)
 
  Deployment :-
   ------------------
 
 => Deployment means moving db from dev server  to prod server
 => once db is deployed then end user can use db for day-to-day transactions
 
 summary :- 
 -----------------

 what is db ?
 what is dbms ?
 what is rdbms ?
 what is ordbms ?
 what is db development life cycle ?

===============================================================

		   	ORACLE
		   	========

  => oracle is basically a  rdbms software and also supports features of ordbms
       and used to manage database.

  => oracle is used for db development & db administration

  versions of oracle :- 
  ----------------------------
  
    2,3,4,5,6,7,8i,9i,10g,11g,12c,18c,19c,21c,23ai,26ai

 		i    =>   internet
	                g   =>   grid
                                 c   =>   cloud
                                 ai  =>  artificial intelligence

  => before 8 oracle supports only desktop application and 8 onwards
       oracle supports web applications.

  => grid means collection of server ,  from ver 10  onwards oracle db can be
       accessed through multiple servers and the advantage of grid is it improves
       availability

 => from 12c onwards oracle db can be deployed 

         1 on premises
         2 on cloud

  => in  " on  premises "  db is deployed in the server managed by client

  =>  in  "  on cloud " db is deployed in the server managed by cloud service provide
        for ex amazon.

 CLIENT / SERVER :- 
 -----------------------------

1 SERVER
2 CLIENT

 SERVER :- 
 ---------------

 => server is  a system where oracle is installed and running
 => oracle server manages two memories

  1  DB
  2  INSTANCE

  => DB is created in hard disk and acts as permanent storage
  =>  INSTANCE is created in ram and acts as temporary storage
  => initially data stored in instance and after saving data copied to db.

 CLIENT :-
 --------------
   
 => client is also a system from where users can 

  1 connects to server
  2 submit requests to server
  3 receive response from server

 client tools :- 
 -----------------

 SQLPLUS  (cui)
 SQL Developer (gui)

 user---------sqlplus-----------------------------------------oracle------------db

 user--------mysqlworkbench-----------------------------mysql------------db

 user--------ssms----------------------------------------------sql server---------db

 user--------pgadmin---------------------------------------postgresql-------------db

 SQL :- 
------------

  => Structured Query Language
  => a language used to communicate with oracle
  => user communicates with oracle by sending commands called queries
  => a query is a command / question to oracle to perform some operation over db
  => SQL is introduced by IBM 
  => SQL is common to all relational db softwares 

  USER------SQLPLUS-----------------------SQL------------------------ORACLE----------DB

  USER-----MYSQLWORKBENCH-----------SQL---------------------MYSQL------------DB

  => based on operations over db SQL is categorized into following sub-languages 

                     DDL (Data Definition Lang)
                     DML (Data Manipulation Lang)
                     DRL (Data Retrieval Lang)
                     TCL  (Transaction Control Lang)
                     DCL  (Data Control Lang)

			SQL

	DDL	DML	DRL	TCL	DCL

                create	insert        select       commit      grant
                alter          update                       rollback     revoke
                drop          delete                        savepoint
                truncate     merge
                rename      insert all
                flashback
                purge

   
  Data & Data Definition :-
 ------------------------------------
    
                 empid	ename	sal      => data definition / metadata 
	100	sachin	6000   => data

 SCHEMA :- 
 ---------------

  => a user in oracle db is called schema
  => objects created by user are called schema objects 

  SERVER
          DATABASE 
                    USER
                            TABLES
                                     DATA 


  SERVER
           ORCL
                 SYS /TIGER                             (DBA)
                 SYSTEM/TIGER                       (DBA)

 How to connect to oracle :- 
 -------------------------------------

 => open sqlplus and enter username & password

           USERNAME :-  SYSTEM
           PASSWORD :-  TIGER

           OR

           USERNAME :-  SYSTEM / TIGER

 Creating New User/Schema/Account :- 
 ------------------------------------------------------

 => only DBAs are having permissions to create new user

  step 1 :-  connect as system

           USERNAME :-  SYSTEM/TIGER

  step 2 :-  create user

Syntax :-
--------------

     CREATE USER <name> IDENTIFIED BY <pwd>
     DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS
     QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS 

 Ex :- 

   CREATE USER BATCH54 DENTIFIEDBY ORACLE
   DEFAULT TABLESPACE USERS
   QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS ;

step 3 :-  granting permissions to user

   GRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE TO BATCH54 ;

                    connect  => to connect to db
                    resource => to create tables
                   dba          =>  all permissions
