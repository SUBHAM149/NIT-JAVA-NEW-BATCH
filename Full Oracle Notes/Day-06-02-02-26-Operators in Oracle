  Operators in oracle :- 
   ---------------------------

   Arithmetic Operators   =>    +    -     *       /       
   Relational Operators   =>   >    >=   <    <=    =     <>    != 
   Logical Operators	      =>   AND  OR   NOT
   Special Operators	      =>   BETWEEN, IN , LIKE,IS,ANY,ALL,EXISTS,PIVOT
   Set Operators	      =>   union,union all,interect,minus

 Displaying Data :- 
 -----------------------

  => "SELECT" command is used to display data  from table
  => we can display all rows or specific rows
  => we can display all columns or specific colun

  syn :-      SELECT  columns / *   FROM  tabname

                    SQL	   =	ENGLISH
	   QUERIES =          SENTENCES
                    CLAUSES =         WORDS
        
                      FROM clause => specify tablename
                      SELECT clause => specify column names 
                                      *         =>  all columns

   => display employee names and salaries ?

       SELECT ename,sal FROM emp ; 

  => display names,salaries and hiredates ?

        SELECT ename,sal,hiredate FROM emp ; 
  
 => display all the data  ?

       SELECT * FROM emp ; 

WHERE clause :- 
-----------------------

 => where cause is used to display specific rows from table
 
   SELECT columns / *
   FROM tabname
   WHERE  condition ; 

 condition :- 
 --------------

            COLNAME  OP   VALUE 

  =>  condition is a relational expression that returns TRUE/FALSE
  => OP must be any relational operator like  >   >=   <   <=   =   <>
  => if  cond = true row is selected
  => if cond = false row is not selected
 
Ex :- 

  => display employee details whose id = 103 ?
  
      SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empid = 103 ; 
 
 => display male employees list ?

     SELECT * FROM emp WHERE gender='m' ; 

 => employees earning more than 5000 ?

    SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal > 5000 ; 

 => employees joined after 2020 ?

     SELECT * FROM emp WHERE hiredate > 2020;   => ERROR
  
    SELECT * FROM emp WHERE hiredate >  '31-DEC-2020' ; 
 
 => employees joine before 2020 ?

   SELECT * FROM emp WHERE hiredate < '01-JAN-2020'  ; 

 => employees not working as analyst ?

     SELECT * FROM emp WHERE  job <> 'analyst' ; 

 Compound Condition :- 
 ---------------------------------

  => multiple conditions combined with  AND / OR  operators is called 
       compound condition

        WHERE  cond1  AND   cond2	 result
                        T		T	T
	       T 		F	F
                        F		T	F
	       F		F	F

        WHERE cond1 OR  cond2	 result
                        T	       T		 T
                        T	       F		 T
                        F	       T		 T
                        F	       F		 F

Ex :- 

  => display employees working as clerk,manager ?

      SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job='clerk'  OR job='manager' ; 
 
 => display employees whose id = 100.103.105 ?

    SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empid=100 OR empid=103 OR empid=105 ; 

 => display male employees  age > 30 ?

     SELECT * FROM emp WHERE gender='m' AND  age > 30 ; 

 => display female employees working as manager and earning more than 5000 ?

     SELECT *
     FROM emp 
     WHERE gender='f'  AND  job='manager'  AND  sal > 5000; 

 => employees working as clerk,manager and earning more than 5000 ?
  
       SELECT *
       FROM emp
       WHERE job='clerk' OR  job='manager'  AND  sal > 5000 ; 
  
      above query displays clerks earning less than 5000 because
      sal > 5000 is applied only to manager but not to clerk because
      operator and has got more priority than opertor or , to overcome this
      use  (   )

       SELECT *
       FROM emp
       WHERE (job='clerk' OR  job='manager')  AND  sal > 5000 ;

 3	C	60	20	10
 4	D	10	20	30

 => display list of students who are passed ?

  SELECT * 
  FROM student
  WHERE s1>=35 AND s2>=35 AND s3>=35 ;
   
 => display list of students who are failed ?

   SELECT *
   FROM student
   WHERE s1<35 OR s2<35 OR s3<35 

=> list of students who are failed in exactly 1 subject ?

  SELECT *
  FROM student
  WHERE   (s1<35 AND s2>=35 AND s3>=35)
                   or
                   (s1>=35 AND s2<35 AND s3>=35)
                   or
                  (s1>=35 AND s2>=35 AND s3<35) ; 

 => list of students who are failed in exactly 2 subjects ?

  SELECT *
  FROM student
  WHERE   (s1<35 AND s2<35 AND s3>=35)
                   OR
                  (s1>=35 AND s2<35 AND s3<35)
                   OR
                  (s1<35 AND s2>=35 AND s3<35);

 => list of students who are failed in all 3 subjects ?

  SELECT *
  FROM student
  WHERE  s1<35 AND s2<35 AND s3<35 ;
